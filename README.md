# Pantheon Terminal task completion notifications support for FISH shell

To enable task completion notifications in Pantheon Terminal for FISH shell,
run the following:

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shnatsel/fish-pantheon-terminal-integration/master/config.fish >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish


This is a temporary hack until we can support FISH out of the box.
